For the usage purpose details, please visit [Get Started](https://garden-iot-eka.vercel.app/started) page, if you any question, drop in the [issues](https://github.com/ekaone/garden-iot/issues), find below a short of Configuration steps:

- 1️⃣ Raspberry PI

  > Makesure you already have [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) module controller 💻

- 2️⃣ Raspberry PI Operating System

  > Download [Raspberry PI Operating system](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), you can choose any OS you like, I recommended use Rasbian OS, it's easy and the most used on Raspberry PI OS 🏡

- 3️⃣ Node JS Runtime

  > [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is Javascript runtime, so we can use this runtime as Programming language on Raspberry PI 🏡

- 4️⃣ Library

  > There some library in the world for Node JS that run on Raspberry PI, such as [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/), [Pigpio](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpi), [Onoff](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff), and so many more, currently we will use Johny Five as controller ⛱
